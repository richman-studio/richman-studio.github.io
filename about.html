			<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
			<p>When I was young, I saw a movie with an Architect seating at a bar and he Sketched a Perspective of a House he had designed for himself and his family on a napkin, from that day I was convinced that Architecture is what I wanted to do when I grew up. This was largely due to the fact that I had a natural talent for sketching, so I thought it would fit me to be an Architect. Even before High School I use to sketch Cartoon Charactors from then popular cartoon programs and I would than sell them at school for lunch money, I was fascinated by the idea of creating things from scratch which were not there to begin with. I would than daydream about Designing Sky Scrapers all through my High School Life.</p>

			<p>After High School I was lucky enough to attend Durban University of Technology (DUT) to studied Architectural Technology, since University I have accumulated Plus 6 years work experience in the Architectural Professional.</p>

			<p>I have worked for Small and Medium sized Practices as a Volunteer and on a Contractual capacity. I have also worked as an Architectural & Graphic Design Consultant, which has allowed me to work with other Professionals and Firms ranging from Contractors, IT Specialists, Architectural Professionals, Quantity Surveyors and many more, this has allowed me to pick up other skills and hobbies like Graphic Design, Web Design & Web Development.</p>

			<p>I have worked on projects ranging from Commercial, Retail, Educational and High-end Residential Architecture. I have an eye for Design, Design Detailing, and I’m wired for Mass Production. I am a curious and very adaptable individual, with a number of necessary Technical Skills to handle Design Work Flow.</p>

			<p>I’m inspired and I have a passion for problem solving.</p>
