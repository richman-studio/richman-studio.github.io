			<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
			<p>When I was young, I saw a movie with an Architect seating at a bar and he drew a perspective of a house he had designed for himself and his family on a napkin, from that day I was convinced that Architecture is what I wanted to do when I grew up. This was largely due to the fact that I knew I had a natural talent for sketching, so I thought it would fit me to be an Architect. This was all before I went to High School, from a young age I was fascinated by the idea of creating things from scratch which were not there to begin with. I would than day dream about Designing Sky Scrapers all through my High School Life.</p>

			<p>After High School I studied Architectural Technology at Durban University of Technology (DUT), since University I have accumulated Plus 5 years work experience in the Architectural Profession.</p>

			<p>I have worked for Small Practices as a Volunteer and on a Contractual capacity. I have also worked as an Architectural & Graphic Design Consultant, which has allowed me to work with other Professionals and Firms ranging from Contractors, IT Specialists, Architectural Professionals, Quantity Surveyors and many more.</p>

			<p>When I was Fulltime in the Field I kicked up Graphic Design from Individuals I worked with who would prepare Designs for Presentation and when I was working as a Consultant I picked up Web Design & Web Development out of necessity. This was largely possible because the flexibility of working as a Consultant allowed the time to teach myself new skills.</p>

			<p>I have worked on projects ranging from Commercial, Retail, Educational and High-end Residential Architectural. I have an eye for Design, Design Detailing, and I’m wired for Mass Production. I am a curious and very adaptable individual, with a number of necessary Technical Skills to handle Design Work Flow.</p>

			<p>I’m inspired and I have a passion for problem solving.</p>

			<p>Thank you for take time to read this.</p>
